# ðŸ§© Portfolio API â€” Django REST Framework

This is the **backend API** for my personal **Portfolio Project**, built with **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
It provides endpoints for managing **Projects**, **Skills**, and **Contact messages**, with full CRUD functionality and Swagger API documentation.
